# MyShell

#### The internal command are all working in myshell
#### Part of the redirection are working in myshell 

### view the lists file. Type -- dir
### change dir type cd (file name), the default route in my computer is /chenerzhang/ so you may want to change the route a little bit

### works file output redirection
### The thing cause shell is messup is string mallocation and pointers in the parse area which makes a lot of error message;
